    <h3><p>The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election, scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.[1] Voters will elect a president and vice president for a term of four years. Incumbent President Joe Biden, a member of the Democratic Party, is running for re-election.[2] His predecessor Donald Trump, a member of the Republican Party, is running for re-election to a second, nonconsecutive term.[3] The victor of this election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

        Prior to the general election, political parties will choose their nominees at nominating conventions. Delegates to the nominating conventions will be chosen by voters in state-level caucuses and primary elections.
        
        The presidential election will occur at the same time as elections to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House. Several states will also hold gubernatorial and state legislative elections. Crime,[4] immigration,[5] gun control,[6][7] healthcare, abortion access,[8] LGBT rights (especially transgender rights), the state of the economy,[9] and democratic backsliding[10] are expected to be leading campaign issues.
        
        Background
        Procedure
        Main article: United States presidential election § Procedure
        Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice. Both incumbent president Biden and former president Donald Trump are eligible to seek reelection. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties of the United States, which is awarded through a process such as a primary election. The primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention.
        
        Similarly, the general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[11] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, a contingent election will be held in which the House of Representatives will select the President from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes (this last happened in 1825), and the Senate will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals (this last happened in 1837).
        
        Election offices are dealing with increased workloads and public scrutiny, so officials in many key states have sought for more funds to hire more personnel, improve security, and extend training. This demand emerges at a moment when numerous election offices are dealing with an increase in retirements and a flood of public record demands, owing in part to the electoral mistrust planted by former President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election.[12]
        
        Both Biden and Trump have announced that they are running for president in 2024, suggesting a potential rematch of the 2020 election, which would be the first presidential rematch since 1956.[13] If Trump is elected, he would become the second president to win a second non-consecutive term, joining Grover Cleveland who did so in 1892.[14]

        Effects of the 2020 census
        Main article: 2020 United States redistricting cycle
        This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census.[15][16] If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same (which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections) in 2024, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 electoral votes and Trump's 232, meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process. This apportionment of electoral college votes will remain only through the 2028 election. Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 United States census.[17]
        
        Electoral partisanship
        Further information: Red states and blue states
        
        Approximate partisan lean of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on the presidential level. The shading of each state denotes the winner's two-party vote share, averaged between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. States that flipped in 2020 are colored grey.
        In recent presidential elections, most states are not competitive, since their demographics keep them solidly behind one party. Because of the nature of the Electoral College, this means that swing states—states that are typically very competitive and "swing" between the Democratic and Republican parties—are vital to winning the presidency. These include states in the Midwestern United States, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and states in the Sun Belt, such as Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia.[18] Due to gradual demographic shifts, some swing states such as Iowa, Ohio, and Florida have shifted significantly towards Republicans, favoring them in statewide and local elections. Meanwhile, states like Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia have moved noticeably towards Democrats, and they have become the dominant political force there.[19][20]
        
        The traditional Democratic electoral coalition, securing the "blue states" for Democratic presidential candidates, is mainly composed of minority groups (especially African-Americans and Latinos), women, educated professionals, and urban voters.[21] Working class voters were also a mainstay of the Democratic coalition since the days of the New Deal, but since the 1970s, many have defected to Republicans as the Democratic Party became significantly more educated, diverse, and culturally liberal.[22] Conversely, the traditional Republican coalition that dominates many "red states" is mainly composed of rural white voters, evangelicals, the elderly, and non-college educated voters.[23] Republicans have also historically performed well with suburban, middle class voters since the 1950s, but this bloc has drifted away from them in recent years due to the rise of the Tea Party movement and later the Make America Great Again movement, a brand of right-wing populism cultivated by former President Donald Trump.[24] The acceleration of this trend has been credited with tipping the 2020 presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, since the incumbent Trump was historically unpopular in the suburbs for a Republican candidate, underperforming there significantly.[25]
        
        Potential campaign issues
        Abortion access
        Main article: Abortion in the United States
        Legal abortion access is expected to be a leading topic, if not the most, of the campaign. This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of two major court rulings that affected access to abortion. The first is the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and permitted U.S. states to fully ban abortion.[8] The second is the 2023 Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in which a federal judge in northwest Texas overturned the FDA's approval of mifepristone in the year 2000, which could potentially pull the medication from the market if upheld by higher courts.[26] Both rulings have received strong support from Republican politicians and lawmakers.[8][26]
        
        In 2022, six states held elections for ballot measures relating to the legality of abortion, and the pro-abortion side was victorious in every case, including in states easily won by Donald Trump.[27] By April 2023, a large majority of Republican-controlled states had passed near-total bans on abortion, rendering it "largely illegal" throughout much of the United States.[8] According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 15 states that have de jure early stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest.[8]
        
        Democrats are predominantly supportive of abortion rights before fetal viability.[28] The topic of abortion will likely play a role in the Republican primary with many potential candidates, such as former vice president Mike Pence, supporting a nationwide ban on the procedure, while other potential candidates prefer criminalization at the state level.[8][29] The topic hasn't received much attention from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is running for president and is widely seen as the leading challenger to former President Donald Trump. However, when a six-week abortion restriction was authorized by the Florida Legislature, DeSantis signed it into law on that day.[30]
        
        Democratic backsliding
        Main article: Democratic backsliding in the United States
        Further information: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, January 6 United States Capitol attack, and Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election
        Donald Trump did not concede defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, and has continued denying the election results as of 2023.[31][32] Republican officials in the Trump administration and in Congress have supported attempts to overturn the election.[33][34] Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process or refuse to certify the 2024 election results.[35]
        
        In the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, FBI director Christopher A. Wray testified that far-right domestic terrorism "has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now, and it's not going away anytime soon."[36] Ali Alexander, who organized one of the many rallies preceding the U.S. Capitol attack, stated in August 2022 that he would be returning to the Capitol building in 2025 "for whatever the Congress certifies."[37]
        
        Voluminous public polling has shown that large majorities of Americans belonging to both political parties believe that democracy in the United States is at risk.[38] Voters often cite different sources of threats to democracy depending on ideology. Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[39] Many conservatives believe that Democrats have cheated in elections,[40] attempted and are still attempting to remove former President Trump from holding public office by any means necessary including impeachment and indictment.[41] Voters of both parties tend to agree that the influence of money in politics, the potential for political violence, and general corruption of public officials are aggravating factors threatening the health of American democracy.[42]
        
        Economic issues
        Main article: Economy of the United States
        Further information: U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemic
        The COVID-19 pandemic left behind significant economic effects which are likely to persist into 2024.[43] A period of high inflation began in 2021, caused by a confluence of events including the pandemic, a supply-chain crisis, and economic effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[44][45] Opinion polling over Biden's handling of the economy has consistently been negative since late 2021.[46] Voters often cite economic issues as their top issue for the 2024 election.[47][48]
        
        Women were particularly affected by the economic downturn in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those who left their work for child-care responsibilities.[49] Temporary child-care measures, including an expanded child tax credit as part of the American Rescue Plan, were introduced as methods designed to help the economic situation of parents, but these all expire before the 2024 election.[50] Biden stated that offering universal pre-kindergarten services as well as caregiver support would be a priority of a second term.[51]
        
        Firearms regulation
        Main articles: Gun violence in the United States and Mass shootings in the United States
        During a National Rifle Association (NRA) conference in Indianapolis on April 14, 2023, Donald Trump and other declared and potential Republican presidential candidates expressed their support for gun owners' rights, on the heels of recent mass shootings in Nashville and Louisville. Democrats criticized the GOP's march of candidates in front of the NRA, saying firearms will be a big issue throughout the 2024 election year.[30]
        
        President Joe Biden has asked Congress to pass an assault weapons ban following the shooting in Nashville.[52]
        
        LGBT rights
        Main articles: LGBT rights in the United States and Transgender rights in the United States
        Further information: 2020s anti-LGBT movement in the United States
        In recent years, conservative politicians in state legislatures have introduced a large and growing number of bills that attack LGBT people, especially transgender people.[53][54]
        
        In a February campaign message, Donald Trump said that if reelected, he would enact a federal law that would recognize only two genders, claimed that being transgender is a concept made up by "the radical left", and would enact nearly a dozen policies that would target transgender Americans. Ron DeSantis has signed several anti-LGBT laws as Governor of Florida, including the controversial Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, more commonly called the "Don't Say Gay" law, which prohibits speaking about sexual orientation and gender identity in Florida public schools. A couple of days before he was to announce his run, DeSantis also signed a slew of bills which included banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors and restricting the use of preferred pronouns in public schools.[55]
        
        Democratic Party
        Main article: 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries
        On April 25, 2023, President Joe Biden announced his run for re-election, keeping Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.[56] Consequently, Republicans have intensified their criticism of Kamala Harris since Joe Biden declared his intention to run for office.[57] During late 2021, as Biden was suffering from low approval ratings, there was speculation that he would not seek re-election,[58] and some prominent Democrats have publicly urged Biden not to run.[59][60][61] In addition to Biden's unpopularity, many are concerned about his age; he was the oldest person to assume the office at age 78 and would be 82 at the end of his first term. If re-elected, he would be 86 at the end of his second term.[62] According to an NBC poll released in April 2023, 70 percent of Americans—including 51 percent of Democrats—believe Biden should not run for a second term. Almost half said it was because of his age. According to the FiveThirtyEight national polling average, Biden's current approval rating is 43 percent, while 53 percent disapprove.[63] There was also speculation that Biden may face a primary challenge from a member of the Democratic Party's progressive faction.[64][65] After Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his party's nomination had increased.[66]

        Republican Party
        Main article: 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries
        Donald Trump, the then-incumbent president, was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election and is eligible to run again in 2024. He filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on November 15, 2022, and announced his candidacy in a speech at Mar-a-Lago the same day.[74][75] Trump is considered an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, following his 2024 campaign announcement on November 15, 2022.[76] However, there are multiple factors working against Trump: the hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack have damaged public opinion towards him,[77][78] in 2022 the FBI searched Trump's estate at Mar-a-Lago,[79][80] in March 2023, Trump was indicted over his hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels,[81] and in May 2023, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation against journalist E. Jean Carroll.[82] However, Trump's poll numbers surged immediately after the Manhattan indictment was announced. A Yahoo News poll shows that in a Republican primary, 57% of respondents would vote for Trump.[83] In a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll, 80% of Republicans surveyed said Trump was being unfairly targeted.[84] Trump announced in March 2022 that if he runs for re-election and wins the Republican presidential nomination, his former vice president Mike Pence will not be his running mate.[85] If Donald Trump and Joe Biden both win their respective parties' nomination, it will be the first presidential rematch since 1956 after Dwight D. Eisenhower successfully ran for reelection against Adlai Stevenson II.
        
        On February 14, 2023, Nikki Haley filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission,[86] and on February 15, 2023, in Charleston, South Carolina, officially announced her candidacy, making her the first challenger to former President Donald Trump's campaign.[87][88][89]
        
        Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is often seen as a main contender to Trump for the presidency; he raised more campaign funds in the first half of 2022 and had more favorable polling numbers than Trump by the end of 2022.[90][91][92] On May 24, 2023, DeSantis announced his candidacy on Twitter in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk. "American decline is not inevitable — it is a choice...I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback", DeSantis added. His campaign stated to have raised $1 million in the first hour following the announcement of his candidacy.[93] Speaking on Fox & Friends, he stated that he would "destroy leftism" in the United States.[94][95]
