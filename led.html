    <h1>LATEST NEWS UPDATE:</h1>
    <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate" style="border:rgb(27, 13, 221) 3px SOLID"><h2 style="color: greenyellow"><p>Four years after a historically large number of candidates ran for president, the field for the 2024 campaign is getting crowded once more, even as it is headlined by the same two aging men who faced off in 2020: President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.
    Updated May 25
    Latest update
    Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, announced his presidential campaign in a glitch-plagued Twitter event with the platform's owner, Elon Musk. Mr. DeSantis, a combative champion of conservative causes, is Donald Trump’s strongest challenger since 2016.       
    More than half a dozen Republicans have already entered the race, and additional candidates may still join them — creating a fractured field that could prevent voters who oppose Mr. Trump from coalescing around a single alternative, just as it did in 2016. 
 S   On the Democratic side, Mr. Biden has drawn only a couple of long-shot challengers</p>
    <p>n April 25, 2023, Biden announced he was running for re-election. It was also announced that Julie Chávez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer were named national campaign co-chairs. Biden's campaign was launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[11] Politico reported that: "Biden is considering Michael Tyler (the longtime Democratic operative) for the role of communications director in his 2024 campaign".[12] The launch date of his 2024 re-election campaign also marks the fourth anniversary of his initial 2020 presidential campaign.[13]</p></h2>.</marquee></body></html>
